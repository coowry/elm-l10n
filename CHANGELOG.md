# Elm L10N Lib - Changelog

# Next release

- Tests added acording to https://github.com/elm-community/elm-test
    1. Run npm install -g elm-test if you haven't already.
    2. cd into the project's root directory that has your elm-package.json.
    3. Run elm-test init. It will create a tests directory inside this one, with some files in it.
    4. Copy all the dependencies from elm-package.json into tests/elm-package.json. These dependencies need to stay in sync, so make sure whenever you change your dependencies in your current elm-package.json, you make the same change to tests/elm-package.json.
    5. Run elm-test.
    6. Edit tests/Example.elm to introduce new tests.
